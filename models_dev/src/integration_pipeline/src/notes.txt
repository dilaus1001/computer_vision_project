First test with only the preprocessing step done during the SKC training
Custom Model Only: 0.8976
Full Pipeline: 0.7692
Accuracy Difference: -0.1284

The model alone perfome better than in the pipeline, maybe due to loss of some contex, probabily the bounding box are too stictly

Test2:
Add a 20% of padding in the YOLO bounding box
the Accuracy doesn't increase, I will try retrain the skc model on cropped images from YOLO
