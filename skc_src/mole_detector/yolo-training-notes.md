# YOLOv8 Training Configuration for Skin Lesion Detection

## Model Selection
YOLOv8 is preferred over YOLOv11 for skin lesion detection due to:
- Superior small object detection capabilities
- Enhanced feature extraction for medical imaging
- Better handling of class imbalance
- Improved performance on high-resolution medical images

## Training Parameters
```python
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model.train(
    data='path/to/dataset.yaml',
    epochs=300,          
    imgsz=640,          
    batch=16,           
    patience=50,        
    augment=True,       
    mixup=0.1,          
    mosaic=0.5,         
    degrees=20,         
    scale=0.5,          
    flipud=0.3,         
    fliplr=0.5,         
    hsv_h=0.015,        
    hsv_s=0.4,          
    hsv_v=0.4           
)
```

## Parameter Justification

1. Image Size (imgsz=640)
   - Higher resolution captures fine lesion details
   - Better detection of small lesions
   - Maintains important texture information

2. Training Duration
   - epochs=300: Extended training for medical pattern recognition
   - patience=50: Allows model to find optimal weights

3. Augmentation Strategy
   - scale=0.5: Handles varying lesion sizes
   - degrees=20: Accounts for different orientation angles
   - flipud=0.3, fliplr=0.5: Orientation invariance
   - hsv_h=0.015: Subtle hue variation for skin tones
   - hsv_s=0.4, hsv_v=0.4: Handles lighting and exposure variations
   - mixup=0.1: Conservative blending preserves lesion characteristics
   - mosaic=0.5: Improves scale invariance

4. Batch Size (batch=16)
   - Balances between memory efficiency and training stability
   - Suitable for medical image processing

## Expected Benefits
- Improved detection of small lesions
- Better handling of varying skin tones and lighting conditions
- Enhanced robustness to orientation and scale variations
- More reliable feature extraction for medical imaging patterns
